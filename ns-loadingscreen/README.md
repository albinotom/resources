# ns-loadingscreen
(v1.1.0) Simple Loading Screen - Loading Bar, MP3 Audio &amp; Controls, and MP4 Video.

# Just Added
- Added more visual responsiveness
- Moved the artist box up so its not covered anymore by Game Loading Text
- Added another option for a full screen video background option as well - Turned on by default

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Please note

- I have built the loading screen for resolution of 1080p. -(Pushed a patch to fix for dynamic background based on viewport)

- If you have a higher res, I am gonna work on making it more responsive. If you want to convert for your size ratio by all means.

- Standalone resource

- Video will need to be replaced (must be mp4 format and under 50mb to work) 

- This Script was tested on the latest build as of 02/3/2021.
